# Practice #1
Recently I've been feeling both over- and understimulated as far as personal time work goes.
I came across the concept of "practicing" frontend by building out designs found on dribbble in code.
Seems fun and useful! I've been streaming my progress in real-time to my friends for background while we hang out online.

I built this project out in Vue and CSS3.

Idea and finder of this design credit goes to [Sasha Tran on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCATAa8MWoBuH-sR_Jlx29A).

[Here is the original design by YesYou Studio on Dribbble.](https://dribbble.com/shots/15298794-UI-Components/attachments/7053864?mode=media)

You can run this project after cloning it with the following commands:
```
npm install
npm run serve
```
